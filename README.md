# industry jobs for physics phds

These are hand-picked jobs for physics phds seeking industry opportunities.

I do not include jobs that are

- completely unrelated to science
- too junior
- related to AI, LLM, ML, unless it's relevant to science
- uninteresting to me
- on quantum computing since there are many jobs. You would know where to look if your phd is on QC. There is no need to check them if your phd is not on QC.

PR is welcome.

## about you
You need to know programming quite well.
As for languages, python, C, and C++ are most popular.

It's best to

- have experience with small coding projects
- solve most easy and medium problems on LeetCode (or other coding interview sites)
- learn unit testing
- learn design patterns

## about me

I got my physics phd in 2011 and joined industry in 2016 ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dong-zhou-84252914/)).
