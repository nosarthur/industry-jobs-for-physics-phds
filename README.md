# industry jobs for physics phds

These are hand-picked jobs for physics phds seeking industry opportunities.

I do not include jobs that are

- completely unrelated to science
- too junior
- related to AI, LLM, ML, unless it's relevant to science
- uninteresting to me

## about you
You need to know programming quite well.
As for languages, python, C, and C++ are most popular.

It's best to

- have experience with small coding projects
- solve most easy and medium problems on LeetCode (or other coding interview sites)
- learn unit testing
- learn design patterns

## about me

I got my physics phd in 2011 and joined industry in 2016 ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dong-zhou-84252914/)).
